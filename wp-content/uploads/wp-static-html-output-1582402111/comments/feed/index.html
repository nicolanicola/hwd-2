					<description><![CDATA[Oh I am glad...I know, I HATE the iOS7 calendar app.  I have a mac and it&#039;s software just updated and the calendar on that has gone all unusable as well.  It&#039;s like they&#039;ve gone for design over usability.  This was never the way when Steve Jobs was there, it was all about being intuitive and easy to use.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I downloaded iTunes store app &#039;Fantastical&#039; based on your recommendation - many thanks, as it solves the issues you mention (and were driving me crazy too) re: getting iOS 6 Month View back.  Made my day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;To get the old ‚ÄúList‚Äù view back in iOS7, just press the search icon&#039;

Yes, that works, but it&#039;s unintuitive. Worse, the view is not stored, so you have to do that most (but not all) times when returning to the calendar. It&#039;s inconsistent enough that I can&#039;t find a pattern. &quot;List&quot; was always my preferred view, and it&#039;s annoying that it can&#039;t hold that setting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think iOS 7 was made for kids.
It is made to look &#039;cool&#039; above all else, and at the expense of ergonomics and human factors, such as readability, simplicity, and useful skeuomorphism.
Observe the video game-like animations, whacky colors, things moving everywhere, thin fonts, white letters on bright colored backgrounds, no &#039;grown-up&#039; or professional-sounding ring tones‚Ä¶ I can go on and on‚Ä¶]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No the released iOS7.  If there are events &#039;tomorrow&#039; then it says there are 2 events, first one is at, say 1pm.  It doesn&#039;t say what they are.  You can&#039;t tap this information to be take to the event or day.  Nor can you tap the calendar icon to be taken to the calendar.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[totally agree! I&#039;m seriously looking at Android right now. iPhone just became a device i don&#039;t want to touch and use.

and a discussion about phone&#039;s keyboard reminded me that Androd actually allows to install 3rd party keyboards - and they have some really cool ones with endless customization options.

Apple believes that it knows better than users what &quot;user experience&quot; they enjoy - and here they bestowed a new keyboard upon us that looks like it came straight from 1987&#039;s HyperCard. sure we must enjoy it without any option to replace.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for starting this thread about the Calendar in IOS7.  

To me, in a word, it is awful!  I live by that Calendar every day. Now it has become an App that I don&#039;t even like accessing because it is just so ugly and unusable. 

Why have I lost the top (almost) 1/3 of the display to a large type font that tells me the month and then a funky (and ugly) rendering of the week with an ugly red dot highlighting the day I&#039;m on?  

The overall effect of all this lost screen real estate is that now I can only see from about 8am to 1pm in this view instead of previously being able to see just about the entire day.

It&#039;s so stripped down in appearance too!  Why did we have to give up the more textured and refined buttons that all make use of the cutting edge graphics of the display and OS in order to have screens that look so flat and uninviting?

The coloring is awful and does not play well for using the phone in a professional environment.

Looking forward to IOS 7.0.3 where they fix these things. (hah)!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe you didn&#039;t notice, it isn&#039;t obvious at all! If you tab a Day in Month-View it will show only the week an your entries for that day! If you want to switch to next week, just swipe left or right on the days. It will switch to next/previous week an select the same weekday!

with the notification center issues, I totally agree :(]]></description>
