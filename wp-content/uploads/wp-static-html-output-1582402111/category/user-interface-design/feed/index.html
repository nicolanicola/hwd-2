								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a lot of features I like in iOS7.  I like the swiping in safari to go back a page, and how quick it is.  I (quite) like the control centre, although it would have been better if <em>I </em>could have chosen what controls I wanted down there.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s an awful lot more I don&#8217;t like though, I think I&#8217;ll devote this post to the calendar app.</p>
<h2>iOS7 Calendar</h2>
<div style="width: 198px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="fancybox" title="ios6 Month View, note in month view you can see what events are on the date currently selected" href="http://i.imgur.com/E4jt9.jpg" rel="gallery"><img alt="ios6 Month View" src="http://i.imgur.com/E4jt9.jpg" width="188" height="282" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">ios6 Month View</p></div>
<div id="attachment_497" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="fancybox" title="What's on today? Don't know, have to tap to find out." href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18.png" rel="gallery"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-497" class="size-medium wp-image-497 " title="ios7 Month View" alt="ios7 Month View" src="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18-169x300.png" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18-169x300.png 169w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18-577x1024.png 577w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18-82x146.png 82w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-497" class="wp-caption-text">ios7 Month View</p></div>
<div id="attachment_498" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="fancybox" title="The month disappears and is replaced by a disconcerting thin strip of dates.  What have I got on next week?" href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26.png" rel="gallery"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-498" class="size-medium wp-image-498 " title="What happens when you tap a day in month view in ios7" alt="What happens when you tap a day in month view in ios7" src="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26-169x300.png" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26-169x300.png 169w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26-577x1024.png 577w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26-82x146.png 82w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-498" class="wp-caption-text">Tap a day in month view</p></div>
<p class="cf">I loved the month view in iOS6.  I loved I could see the whole month, at a glance and see through the dots on each day, which days had events on them.  You tapped the day, the events on that day  were listed underneath.  </p>
<p>Apple has completed ruined my easy to use, comfortable, all-encompassing planning experience with their new calendar.  Forget the aesthetics, which incidentally, I don&#8217;t like, so much white feels scary, there&#8217;s nothing there, no reference points, what is this, what am I looking at?  Wait calm down, it&#8217;s just a very minimal design.  </p>
<p>So, yeh, what I REALLY HATE about it is the fact that now, when you tap to see what&#8217;s on on a day, the month view disappears and a week view shows instead.  Woah, wait a minute!  That&#8217;s a bit disorientating!  I want to see what I have on in a day relative to other days in the month. I may be thinking I have an appointment on that day.  Oh no, maybe its next week, oh, can&#8217;t see next week, need to tap on the month name (intuitive I don&#8217;t think so) and then look at the next week, tap on the day&#8230;I cannot quickly see one day&#8217;s events in one weeks in comparison with another day the week after.  I hate it so much, i&#8217;ve gone a bought a calendar app called <a title="Fantastical" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fantastical/id575647534?mt=8" target="_blank">fantastical</a> that gives me that simple to use month view.  I&#8217;m not so keen on the colours they use, but it&#8217;s less important that it being usable!  Something Apple were revered for.  Simplicity and usability.  With this, is it a case of form over function?  Minimalism over usability?</p>
<div id="attachment_508" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="fancybox" title="Tap all you like, nothing on here is a link to the calendar app." href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35.png" rel="gallery"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-508" class="size-medium wp-image-508 " title="No links here" alt="ios7 missing links notification centre" src="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35-169x300.png" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35-169x300.png 169w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35-577x1024.png 577w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35-82x146.png 82w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-508" class="wp-caption-text">No links here</p></div>
<p>While I&#8217;m on the calendar app, something else that really bugs me its the notification centre that shows you what you have coming up.  </p>
<p>It helpfully tells me I have one event tomorrow.  What on earth is that event?  Why not tell me?  Ok, well I&#8217;ll tap the words &#8216;there is one all-day event..&#8217;, that&#8217;ll take me to the event.  No.  Nothing.  I&#8217;ll try pressing Calendar, maybe?  No, that does nothing either.  So, what is the point of telling me anything here, if I can&#8217;t quickly find out what it is?  I was really shocked at this missing most basic of functionality.  </p>
<p>YET, if I tap the little weather info snippet, it opens the weather app.  Ahh don&#8217;t you just love consistency? </p>
<p>I like good design.  I know people are raving about how pretty the new UI is. Well I&#8217;d rather have usable over pretty.  Sure the old gradients and drop shadows look a bit dated, but <strong>I&#8217;d rather have that than a disconcerting, inconsistent user experience.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I have been spoiled with Apple.  I expect perfection. I expect not to have to think.  I expect things to be clear, to work, to make sense.  I wasn&#8217;t aware that I had these expectations until yesterday, when I switched from Sky HD to Virgin Media, with their Tivo box.</p>
<h2>Crash!</h2>
<p>So as soon as the engineer goes, I try to work it.  I pick up the remote, note how cluttered it is, how unfriendly it is, and proceed to try to work out which arrow pad controls the interface.  I then managed to get to a search screen.  It crashes.  Nothing works.  Just a continuous negative sounding THUD, THUD, THUD, as I press the buttons trying to get them to do something.  I switch it off at the mains and back on again.</p>
<h2>Search Pains</h2>
<p>So I don&#8217;t watch much TV, but I do love Britain &amp; Ireland&#8217;s Next Top Model.  So I painfully navigate to a search screen, and unsure of what I was searching through &#8211; was it collections, tv shows, hd content, on demand content (all these items and more were listed down the side to aid my confusion &#8211; I just wanted to search the TV guide!); I proceeded to search for BINTM.  It finds it, but&#8230;in HD.  I&#8217;m not subscribed to HD.  So I look down the list for the SD version.  Nothing.  I know it&#8217;s on!  I wasn&#8217;t sure when though.  So, I think, maybe I&#8217;ll remote record it via Virgin&#8217;s website.  I go to virgins website.  I can&#8217;t find anything anywhere about remote record.  I give up and go to google and search for virgin remote record.  Result!  I click to go though to Virgin&#8217;s website, sign into this tv guide (so it can record to my box) then look for the search box to search for when my program is on.  I look, I look some more, I scroll down, I try different links.  THERE IS NO SEARCH BOX!  What are they thinking?  So, I went to sky&#8217;s tv guide instead and searched for it.  </p>
<p>Now I had my time and date, all I had to do was find the tv show on the tivo box.  I managed that and chose the red record button.  Several options came up, one of which was express series link.  Now, is this different for normal series link I wondered?  Hmm let&#8217;s look.  Oh, there is no series link, only express series link.  So why call it express?  It&#8217;s the only one there is, so it&#8217;s not in comparison to another series link. Talk about confusing!  </p>
<p>So I pressed express series link and was presented with a horrendous upscaled standard definition screen with massive blurry fonts on asking me what I wanted to do.  I couldn&#8217;t believe it!  Who on earth authorised the release of the Tivo UI without these screens being done in HD?  It&#8217;s half finished, it&#8217;s terrible!  I was shocked and from then on had no respect for Virgin&#8217;s integrity.  Sure they&#8217;ll spend millions on advertising but they wont spend anything on getting the UI finished.  Can you imagine apple doing that?  Releasing iOS7 with the general scree in settings really blurred because they hadn&#8217;t got round to finishing that? </p>
<h2>Remote Control HELL</h2>
<p>Oh it was painful.  I wanted to go back often.  Where was the backup button?  There&#8217;s one near the bottom of the remote, so whilst I&#8217;m up the top of the remote browsing, pressing select, to go back, I have to look down and move my whole hand down to navigate to the back button.  Bad, bad, bad design.  Bad user experience.  There are too many buttons.  It&#8217;s no clear what any of them do.  Some of them that are really important are tiny, such as the guide button.  There are two direction pads, one at the top and one at the bottom.  The one at the bottom has pause in the middle.  This is the biggest button.  Pause?  Come on, do they think this is what people do most often?  Play I could kind of understand, but select, that makes most sense, you are continuously selecting things you want to do via your remote.</p>
<h2>Lesson Learned</h2>
<p>If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it.  Last year I went from iOS to Android and hated using it for a full 8 months until I went out and bought an iPhone 5 about 2 weeks ago.  I missed the simplicity and the friendliness.  The absence of clutter.  The reliability.  It seems the same has happened here.  Thankfully, I have a cooling off period.  Phew.  </p>
