								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kirkburton Pre school are a small voluntary organisation based in Kirkburton, Huddersfield.  As they are a charitable organisation, they didn&#8217;t have a large budget.  I don&#8217;t mind this.  I like to help out my local area.  Help people who are doing good.</p>
<p>They already had a logo.  They weren&#8217;t sure what colours to go for and what style.  We looked at a few different preschool/nursery websites and primary school websites.  They all seemed to be aimed at children.  They used primary colours and looked more fitting to a children&#8217;s website.  It was important to recognise that this site was for parents.  That didn&#8217;t mean it had to be serious and boring.  Oh no!  They told me they used pink and green a lot in their pre school.  So I took those colours and applied it to their site.</p>
<p>Kirkburton pre school luckily had a lot of lovely images of the children, which made the website look great, it came alive.</p>
<p>As the site was build in wordpress, the volunteers were able to go in and update it themselves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XL Projects needed a website fast.  My client contacted me with an urgent request for a website.  They had all the content, but just needed a design to pull it altogether.  Their sister company Kelland already had a logo, so I suggested we use the same logo style as Kelland.  My client agreed.</p>
<p>I was a bit flummoxed as to how I would make a site about Injection Moulding look pretty.  However I quickly did some designs in photoshop with the content my client had gave me, using the colours from the logo.  I was very pleased with the results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client was dissatisfied with his old website design.  The background was very dark which drowned out the photos.  He came to me wanting a fresh, bright website which let the photos, rather than the design, do the talking.  He also wanted the website to respond to different screen sizes, showing a different layout depending on if viewed on a smartphone, tablet or laptop.  The site needed to feature a prints section where people could buy a print through Paypal.</p>
<p>I designed a very minimal website based around his logo.  The theme was black &amp; white.  It was contrast.  The black and white of the logo mirrored the contrast between the colour in the photos and the minimal white background.</p>

<p>My client wanted a simple, uncluttered look, with the homepage being an advertisement for the band.  I redesigned their website to have a clean and elegant look.  The site showcases their performances and their imagery, giving a classy, well presented look and feel.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a very exciting project.  My client was from Bedford and had received bad service from a well known company for her website build.  She came to me wanting a logo designed and a website that was in English and Polish.  With her business being translation, she didn&#8217;t want to use an automatic language translator such as Google Translate.  I thus created her a WordPress site which she could edit fully, and that enabled her to add content in two different languages.  The website has a flag on it, which when clicked, sets a preference in the visitors internet browser.  English content or Polish content is then shown depending on which language the visitor chose.</p>
<p>The red colouring of the brand was my clients request.  I created a few website designs for her to look through, from which she chose the design you see before you.</p>
<p>I also created a logo for my client.  She wanted the words <em>pen</em> and <em>translations </em>encompassing in a logo.  The result is a speech bubble with the top of a fountain pen.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This client, based in Huddersfield contacted me for 2 websites.  They specialise in auto electrics in Huddersfield.  After completing their first website, <a title="Autolec HD, Car Electrician" href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/websites/autolec-hd-car-electrician/">Autolec HD</a>, I went onto design their motorhome website.  My client wanted a clean, minimal site to appeal to the more discerning customer.  After receiving the stock photography my client had purchased, I realised that the motorhome image  sold the website and the brand on it&#8217;s own.  So I decided to make that the main focus of the homepage.  Not only does it immediately says what the website is about, but it looks great too.  I echoed this style through the rest of the site, keeping it white and minimal.</p>
<p>I advised my client how to write the content for SEO and added this to the site.  Autolec now have the freedom to edit the website, adding images and text whenever they want, they don&#8217;t have to ring me any time they need anything changing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project was for an auto-electrician in Huddersfield.  They already had a website that they had built with 1and1 hosting, but wanted something with a more streamlined feel, that incorporated their logo.</p>
<p>I based the design of the site on their logo.  The logo was black and orange, so I reflected this colour scheme in the rest of the site design.  One of the things I pointed out to them on their old site was that it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear what they did, on landing on their homepage.  Bearing this in mind, I worked with Autolec HD to create a more streamlined structure, with all their services listed on one page.  Each service they provide has it&#8217;s own page, for clarity to the viewer and for SEO (search engine optimisation) purposes.  I also made sure with the design of the homepage that it was immediately clear that this was an auto electrician, by using design principles and carefully named section headings.</p>
<p>Autolec HD needed some images for their website.  So I arranged to take some with my dSLR at their premises.  I got a great shot of them both smiling naturally, have a look at their <a href="http://autolechd.co.uk/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about page</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Cleckheaton Tiling Website started off from scratch, with no logo or even company name!  A logo was first thing this client needed.  He wanted to adapt it to fit business cards along with a website.  We discussed the kind of website he was looking for, and identified that he was wanting to aim himself quite upmarket.  This then led me to the logo design which is simply his name and the word &#8217;tiling&#8217;.  We chose this because it would be easy for people to remember as a url, and it described what he was doing perfectly.</p>
<p>I chose a classical font to imbue a feeling of quality.  I iterated how important it was that someone landing on the site knew exactly was the site was selling, with this in mind, I chose bathroom tiles as a backdrop.</p>
