								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kirkburton Pre school are a small voluntary organisation based in Kirkburton, Huddersfield.  As they are a charitable organisation, they didn&#8217;t have a large budget.  I don&#8217;t mind this.  I like to help out my local area.  Help people who are doing good.</p>
<p>They already had a logo.  They weren&#8217;t sure what colours to go for and what style.  We looked at a few different preschool/nursery websites and primary school websites.  They all seemed to be aimed at children.  They used primary colours and looked more fitting to a children&#8217;s website.  It was important to recognise that this site was for parents.  That didn&#8217;t mean it had to be serious and boring.  Oh no!  They told me they used pink and green a lot in their pre school.  So I took those colours and applied it to their site.</p>
<p>Kirkburton pre school luckily had a lot of lovely images of the children, which made the website look great, it came alive.</p>
<p>As the site was build in wordpress, the volunteers were able to go in and update it themselves.</p>
