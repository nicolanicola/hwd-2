								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client approached me with a real need for his website to be revamped.  People found it confusing, couldn&#8217;t find what they were looking for, and worse, thought he didn&#8217;t do commercial work.</p>
<p>I worked with him to find a solution to the problem of him having two audiences &#8211; commercial and domestic customers.  Together we came up with the idea of having a tabbed menu so the specific type of customer could easily find the section they wanted.</p>
<p>I thought it was important that the site have a warm, bright and optimistic feel, as well as feeling very back to nature.  It had to feel like renewable energy.</p>
<p>My client was happy to report to me that within the first week he had already had an enquiry through the website, his other website had yielded no contacts, and had been up over a year!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a very exciting project.  My client was from Bedford and had received bad service from a well known company for her website build.  She came to me wanting a logo designed and a website that was in English and Polish.  With her business being translation, she didn&#8217;t want to use an automatic language translator such as Google Translate.  I thus created her a WordPress site which she could edit fully, and that enabled her to add content in two different languages.  The website has a flag on it, which when clicked, sets a preference in the visitors internet browser.  English content or Polish content is then shown depending on which language the visitor chose.</p>
<p>The red colouring of the brand was my clients request.  I created a few website designs for her to look through, from which she chose the design you see before you.</p>
<p>I also created a logo for my client.  She wanted the words <em>pen</em> and <em>translations </em>encompassing in a logo.  The result is a speech bubble with the top of a fountain pen.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project was for an auto-electrician in Huddersfield.  They already had a website that they had built with 1and1 hosting, but wanted something with a more streamlined feel, that incorporated their logo.</p>
<p>I based the design of the site on their logo.  The logo was black and orange, so I reflected this colour scheme in the rest of the site design.  One of the things I pointed out to them on their old site was that it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear what they did, on landing on their homepage.  Bearing this in mind, I worked with Autolec HD to create a more streamlined structure, with all their services listed on one page.  Each service they provide has it&#8217;s own page, for clarity to the viewer and for SEO (search engine optimisation) purposes.  I also made sure with the design of the homepage that it was immediately clear that this was an auto electrician, by using design principles and carefully named section headings.</p>
<p>Autolec HD needed some images for their website.  So I arranged to take some with my dSLR at their premises.  I got a great shot of them both smiling naturally, have a look at their <a href="http://autolechd.co.uk/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about page</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Cleckheaton Tiling Website started off from scratch, with no logo or even company name!  A logo was first thing this client needed.  He wanted to adapt it to fit business cards along with a website.  We discussed the kind of website he was looking for, and identified that he was wanting to aim himself quite upmarket.  This then led me to the logo design which is simply his name and the word &#8217;tiling&#8217;.  We chose this because it would be easy for people to remember as a url, and it described what he was doing perfectly.</p>
<p>I chose a classical font to imbue a feeling of quality.  I iterated how important it was that someone landing on the site knew exactly was the site was selling, with this in mind, I chose bathroom tiles as a backdrop.</p>
