								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client approached me with a real need for his website to be revamped.  People found it confusing, couldn&#8217;t find what they were looking for, and worse, thought he didn&#8217;t do commercial work.</p>
<p>I worked with him to find a solution to the problem of him having two audiences &#8211; commercial and domestic customers.  Together we came up with the idea of having a tabbed menu so the specific type of customer could easily find the section they wanted.</p>
<p>I thought it was important that the site have a warm, bright and optimistic feel, as well as feeling very back to nature.  It had to feel like renewable energy.</p>
<p>My client was happy to report to me that within the first week he had already had an enquiry through the website, his other website had yielded no contacts, and had been up over a year!</p>

<p>My client wanted a simple, uncluttered look, with the homepage being an advertisement for the band.  I redesigned their website to have a clean and elegant look.  The site showcases their performances and their imagery, giving a classy, well presented look and feel.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This client, based in Huddersfield contacted me for 2 websites.  They specialise in auto electrics in Huddersfield.  After completing their first website, <a title="Autolec HD, Car Electrician" href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/websites/autolec-hd-car-electrician/">Autolec HD</a>, I went onto design their motorhome website.  My client wanted a clean, minimal site to appeal to the more discerning customer.  After receiving the stock photography my client had purchased, I realised that the motorhome image  sold the website and the brand on it&#8217;s own.  So I decided to make that the main focus of the homepage.  Not only does it immediately says what the website is about, but it looks great too.  I echoed this style through the rest of the site, keeping it white and minimal.</p>
<p>I advised my client how to write the content for SEO and added this to the site.  Autolec now have the freedom to edit the website, adding images and text whenever they want, they don&#8217;t have to ring me any time they need anything changing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project was for an auto-electrician in Huddersfield.  They already had a website that they had built with 1and1 hosting, but wanted something with a more streamlined feel, that incorporated their logo.</p>
<p>I based the design of the site on their logo.  The logo was black and orange, so I reflected this colour scheme in the rest of the site design.  One of the things I pointed out to them on their old site was that it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear what they did, on landing on their homepage.  Bearing this in mind, I worked with Autolec HD to create a more streamlined structure, with all their services listed on one page.  Each service they provide has it&#8217;s own page, for clarity to the viewer and for SEO (search engine optimisation) purposes.  I also made sure with the design of the homepage that it was immediately clear that this was an auto electrician, by using design principles and carefully named section headings.</p>
<p>Autolec HD needed some images for their website.  So I arranged to take some with my dSLR at their premises.  I got a great shot of them both smiling naturally, have a look at their <a href="http://autolechd.co.uk/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about page</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project was a simple redesign of the existing site.  Huddersfield Driving School already had a website.  They wanted some social icons adding such as facebook like button, and twitter share button.  They also required a feed from their facebook page, which meant whenever they made a new post on their facebook page, it would come through onto their website.</p>
<p>The site was integrated with paypal, enabling visitors to the site to buy driving lessons over the internet with their paypal account.</p>
<p>We also decided to go for a redesign as well to make it brighter and more inviting to users.  The original html and content was kept exactly the same and extra content such as the recently passed carousel was added to the top of the page.</p>
