								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kirkburton Pre school are a small voluntary organisation based in Kirkburton, Huddersfield.  As they are a charitable organisation, they didn&#8217;t have a large budget.  I don&#8217;t mind this.  I like to help out my local area.  Help people who are doing good.</p>
<p>They already had a logo.  They weren&#8217;t sure what colours to go for and what style.  We looked at a few different preschool/nursery websites and primary school websites.  They all seemed to be aimed at children.  They used primary colours and looked more fitting to a children&#8217;s website.  It was important to recognise that this site was for parents.  That didn&#8217;t mean it had to be serious and boring.  Oh no!  They told me they used pink and green a lot in their pre school.  So I took those colours and applied it to their site.</p>
<p>Kirkburton pre school luckily had a lot of lovely images of the children, which made the website look great, it came alive.</p>
<p>As the site was build in wordpress, the volunteers were able to go in and update it themselves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XL Projects needed a website fast.  My client contacted me with an urgent request for a website.  They had all the content, but just needed a design to pull it altogether.  Their sister company Kelland already had a logo, so I suggested we use the same logo style as Kelland.  My client agreed.</p>
<p>I was a bit flummoxed as to how I would make a site about Injection Moulding look pretty.  However I quickly did some designs in photoshop with the content my client had gave me, using the colours from the logo.  I was very pleased with the results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client came to me wanting a website for his company.  He had already created a logo and knew the colour scheme he wanted.  What he didn&#8217;t want was a standard website, that looked like every other site.</p>
<p>I wanted to show in the design what my client&#8217;s business was about.  I spoke to him about who his ideal website visitors were, and what they would be looking for if they were looking to hire someone like himself.  We decided it was important that they know straight off what he did.  I achieved this through large typography on the homepage, and through the use of my clients blueprints for the background images for the pages.  I was concerned that the size of these images may impact mobile users, who would be using their mobile data allowance.  So I coded a slightly different view for mobile users &#8211; a website with just a white background on each page.  They then wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the website hogging all their mobile data allowance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client approached me with a real need for his website to be revamped.  People found it confusing, couldn&#8217;t find what they were looking for, and worse, thought he didn&#8217;t do commercial work.</p>
<p>I worked with him to find a solution to the problem of him having two audiences &#8211; commercial and domestic customers.  Together we came up with the idea of having a tabbed menu so the specific type of customer could easily find the section they wanted.</p>
<p>I thought it was important that the site have a warm, bright and optimistic feel, as well as feeling very back to nature.  It had to feel like renewable energy.</p>
<p>My client was happy to report to me that within the first week he had already had an enquiry through the website, his other website had yielded no contacts, and had been up over a year!</p>

<p>My client wanted a simple, uncluttered look, with the homepage being an advertisement for the band.  I redesigned their website to have a clean and elegant look.  The site showcases their performances and their imagery, giving a classy, well presented look and feel.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a very exciting project.  My client was from Bedford and had received bad service from a well known company for her website build.  She came to me wanting a logo designed and a website that was in English and Polish.  With her business being translation, she didn&#8217;t want to use an automatic language translator such as Google Translate.  I thus created her a WordPress site which she could edit fully, and that enabled her to add content in two different languages.  The website has a flag on it, which when clicked, sets a preference in the visitors internet browser.  English content or Polish content is then shown depending on which language the visitor chose.</p>
<p>The red colouring of the brand was my clients request.  I created a few website designs for her to look through, from which she chose the design you see before you.</p>
<p>I also created a logo for my client.  She wanted the words <em>pen</em> and <em>translations </em>encompassing in a logo.  The result is a speech bubble with the top of a fountain pen.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This client, based in Huddersfield contacted me for 2 websites.  They specialise in auto electrics in Huddersfield.  After completing their first website, <a title="Autolec HD, Car Electrician" href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/websites/autolec-hd-car-electrician/">Autolec HD</a>, I went onto design their motorhome website.  My client wanted a clean, minimal site to appeal to the more discerning customer.  After receiving the stock photography my client had purchased, I realised that the motorhome image  sold the website and the brand on it&#8217;s own.  So I decided to make that the main focus of the homepage.  Not only does it immediately says what the website is about, but it looks great too.  I echoed this style through the rest of the site, keeping it white and minimal.</p>
<p>I advised my client how to write the content for SEO and added this to the site.  Autolec now have the freedom to edit the website, adding images and text whenever they want, they don&#8217;t have to ring me any time they need anything changing.</p>
