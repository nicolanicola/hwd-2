								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XL Projects needed a website fast.  My client contacted me with an urgent request for a website.  They had all the content, but just needed a design to pull it altogether.  Their sister company Kelland already had a logo, so I suggested we use the same logo style as Kelland.  My client agreed.</p>
<p>I was a bit flummoxed as to how I would make a site about Injection Moulding look pretty.  However I quickly did some designs in photoshop with the content my client had gave me, using the colours from the logo.  I was very pleased with the results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a very exciting project.  My client was from Bedford and had received bad service from a well known company for her website build.  She came to me wanting a logo designed and a website that was in English and Polish.  With her business being translation, she didn&#8217;t want to use an automatic language translator such as Google Translate.  I thus created her a WordPress site which she could edit fully, and that enabled her to add content in two different languages.  The website has a flag on it, which when clicked, sets a preference in the visitors internet browser.  English content or Polish content is then shown depending on which language the visitor chose.</p>
<p>The red colouring of the brand was my clients request.  I created a few website designs for her to look through, from which she chose the design you see before you.</p>
<p>I also created a logo for my client.  She wanted the words <em>pen</em> and <em>translations </em>encompassing in a logo.  The result is a speech bubble with the top of a fountain pen.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Cleckheaton Tiling Website started off from scratch, with no logo or even company name!  A logo was first thing this client needed.  He wanted to adapt it to fit business cards along with a website.  We discussed the kind of website he was looking for, and identified that he was wanting to aim himself quite upmarket.  This then led me to the logo design which is simply his name and the word &#8217;tiling&#8217;.  We chose this because it would be easy for people to remember as a url, and it described what he was doing perfectly.</p>
<p>I chose a classical font to imbue a feeling of quality.  I iterated how important it was that someone landing on the site knew exactly was the site was selling, with this in mind, I chose bathroom tiles as a backdrop.</p>
