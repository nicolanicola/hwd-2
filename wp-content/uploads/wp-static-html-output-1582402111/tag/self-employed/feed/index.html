								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Cleckheaton Tiling Website started off from scratch, with no logo or even company name!  A logo was first thing this client needed.  He wanted to adapt it to fit business cards along with a website.  We discussed the kind of website he was looking for, and identified that he was wanting to aim himself quite upmarket.  This then led me to the logo design which is simply his name and the word &#8217;tiling&#8217;.  We chose this because it would be easy for people to remember as a url, and it described what he was doing perfectly.</p>
<p>I chose a classical font to imbue a feeling of quality.  I iterated how important it was that someone landing on the site knew exactly was the site was selling, with this in mind, I chose bathroom tiles as a backdrop.</p>
