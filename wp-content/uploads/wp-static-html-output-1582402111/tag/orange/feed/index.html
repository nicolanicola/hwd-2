								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project was for an auto-electrician in Huddersfield.  They already had a website that they had built with 1and1 hosting, but wanted something with a more streamlined feel, that incorporated their logo.</p>
<p>I based the design of the site on their logo.  The logo was black and orange, so I reflected this colour scheme in the rest of the site design.  One of the things I pointed out to them on their old site was that it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear what they did, on landing on their homepage.  Bearing this in mind, I worked with Autolec HD to create a more streamlined structure, with all their services listed on one page.  Each service they provide has it&#8217;s own page, for clarity to the viewer and for SEO (search engine optimisation) purposes.  I also made sure with the design of the homepage that it was immediately clear that this was an auto electrician, by using design principles and carefully named section headings.</p>
<p>Autolec HD needed some images for their website.  So I arranged to take some with my dSLR at their premises.  I got a great shot of them both smiling naturally, have a look at their <a href="http://autolechd.co.uk/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about page</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PLG Engineering of Mirfield, Huddersfield contacted me asking me whether I could create them a brochure website advertising what they did.  They found that people had been looking for them online and when they didn&#8217;t find them, were a bit unsure of them, or whether or not they existed.  They wanted this website to give themselves an online presence.  They already had a logo so I took the colours from that logo and used them in the design of the site.  The colours being red and yellow worked very well since they were a heating engineering company, so when you went on the site, you immediately had a feeling of warmth.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t need many pages, just enough to show their products, who they were and how to get in touch with them.  They were very pleased with the end product, liking how clear it was to see who they were and what they did.</p>
