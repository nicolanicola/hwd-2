								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a lot of features I like in iOS7.  I like the swiping in safari to go back a page, and how quick it is.  I (quite) like the control centre, although it would have been better if <em>I </em>could have chosen what controls I wanted down there.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s an awful lot more I don&#8217;t like though, I think I&#8217;ll devote this post to the calendar app.</p>
<h2>iOS7 Calendar</h2>
<div style="width: 198px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="fancybox" title="ios6 Month View, note in month view you can see what events are on the date currently selected" href="http://i.imgur.com/E4jt9.jpg" rel="gallery"><img alt="ios6 Month View" src="http://i.imgur.com/E4jt9.jpg" width="188" height="282" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">ios6 Month View</p></div>
<div id="attachment_497" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="fancybox" title="What's on today? Don't know, have to tap to find out." href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18.png" rel="gallery"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-497" class="size-medium wp-image-497 " title="ios7 Month View" alt="ios7 Month View" src="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18-169x300.png" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18-169x300.png 169w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18-577x1024.png 577w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18-82x146.png 82w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.18.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-497" class="wp-caption-text">ios7 Month View</p></div>
<div id="attachment_498" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="fancybox" title="The month disappears and is replaced by a disconcerting thin strip of dates.  What have I got on next week?" href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26.png" rel="gallery"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-498" class="size-medium wp-image-498 " title="What happens when you tap a day in month view in ios7" alt="What happens when you tap a day in month view in ios7" src="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26-169x300.png" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26-169x300.png 169w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26-577x1024.png 577w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26-82x146.png 82w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-21.58.26.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-498" class="wp-caption-text">Tap a day in month view</p></div>
<p class="cf">I loved the month view in iOS6.  I loved I could see the whole month, at a glance and see through the dots on each day, which days had events on them.  You tapped the day, the events on that day  were listed underneath.  </p>
<p>Apple has completed ruined my easy to use, comfortable, all-encompassing planning experience with their new calendar.  Forget the aesthetics, which incidentally, I don&#8217;t like, so much white feels scary, there&#8217;s nothing there, no reference points, what is this, what am I looking at?  Wait calm down, it&#8217;s just a very minimal design.  </p>
<p>So, yeh, what I REALLY HATE about it is the fact that now, when you tap to see what&#8217;s on on a day, the month view disappears and a week view shows instead.  Woah, wait a minute!  That&#8217;s a bit disorientating!  I want to see what I have on in a day relative to other days in the month. I may be thinking I have an appointment on that day.  Oh no, maybe its next week, oh, can&#8217;t see next week, need to tap on the month name (intuitive I don&#8217;t think so) and then look at the next week, tap on the day&#8230;I cannot quickly see one day&#8217;s events in one weeks in comparison with another day the week after.  I hate it so much, i&#8217;ve gone a bought a calendar app called <a title="Fantastical" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fantastical/id575647534?mt=8" target="_blank">fantastical</a> that gives me that simple to use month view.  I&#8217;m not so keen on the colours they use, but it&#8217;s less important that it being usable!  Something Apple were revered for.  Simplicity and usability.  With this, is it a case of form over function?  Minimalism over usability?</p>
<div id="attachment_508" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a class="fancybox" title="Tap all you like, nothing on here is a link to the calendar app." href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35.png" rel="gallery"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-508" class="size-medium wp-image-508 " title="No links here" alt="ios7 missing links notification centre" src="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35-169x300.png" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35-169x300.png 169w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35-577x1024.png 577w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35-82x146.png 82w, https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23-22.23.35.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-508" class="wp-caption-text">No links here</p></div>
<p>While I&#8217;m on the calendar app, something else that really bugs me its the notification centre that shows you what you have coming up.  </p>
<p>It helpfully tells me I have one event tomorrow.  What on earth is that event?  Why not tell me?  Ok, well I&#8217;ll tap the words &#8216;there is one all-day event..&#8217;, that&#8217;ll take me to the event.  No.  Nothing.  I&#8217;ll try pressing Calendar, maybe?  No, that does nothing either.  So, what is the point of telling me anything here, if I can&#8217;t quickly find out what it is?  I was really shocked at this missing most basic of functionality.  </p>
<p>YET, if I tap the little weather info snippet, it opens the weather app.  Ahh don&#8217;t you just love consistency? </p>
<p>I like good design.  I know people are raving about how pretty the new UI is. Well I&#8217;d rather have usable over pretty.  Sure the old gradients and drop shadows look a bit dated, but <strong>I&#8217;d rather have that than a disconcerting, inconsistent user experience.</strong></p>
