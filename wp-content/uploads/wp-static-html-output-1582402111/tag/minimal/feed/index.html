								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client came to me wanting a website for his company.  He had already created a logo and knew the colour scheme he wanted.  What he didn&#8217;t want was a standard website, that looked like every other site.</p>
<p>I wanted to show in the design what my client&#8217;s business was about.  I spoke to him about who his ideal website visitors were, and what they would be looking for if they were looking to hire someone like himself.  We decided it was important that they know straight off what he did.  I achieved this through large typography on the homepage, and through the use of my clients blueprints for the background images for the pages.  I was concerned that the size of these images may impact mobile users, who would be using their mobile data allowance.  So I coded a slightly different view for mobile users &#8211; a website with just a white background on each page.  They then wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the website hogging all their mobile data allowance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This client, based in Huddersfield contacted me for 2 websites.  They specialise in auto electrics in Huddersfield.  After completing their first website, <a title="Autolec HD, Car Electrician" href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/websites/autolec-hd-car-electrician/">Autolec HD</a>, I went onto design their motorhome website.  My client wanted a clean, minimal site to appeal to the more discerning customer.  After receiving the stock photography my client had purchased, I realised that the motorhome image  sold the website and the brand on it&#8217;s own.  So I decided to make that the main focus of the homepage.  Not only does it immediately says what the website is about, but it looks great too.  I echoed this style through the rest of the site, keeping it white and minimal.</p>
<p>I advised my client how to write the content for SEO and added this to the site.  Autolec now have the freedom to edit the website, adding images and text whenever they want, they don&#8217;t have to ring me any time they need anything changing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well I&#8217;m pleased to say my new website i.e. this, is now launched!  I&#8217;m very excited about it.  I am so pleased with the design.  I am normally quite picky with myself when it comes to designing, but with this it seems to have gone really well.  I wanted to achieve a minimalist bare but clean and professional looking site, with a minimal colour palette.  I chose green because a, it&#8217;s my favourite colour and b, I think it&#8217;s so fresh and vibrant.  With the light grey colour palette, there needed to be a strong colour to give the site some life, which I think the green has done nicely.</p>
<p>I had to create the logo as well which I think works well with the brand.  The forward slash between the words is a reference to the web.  I&#8217;m looking forwards to adapting the design to some business cards.  When I get them done I&#8217;ll take some pictures and post on here.</p>
<p>I also love the design I did on the previous site to this one &#8211; <a title="Photography E-Commerce Site" href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/projects/photography-e-commerce-site/">David Speight Photography</a>, also very clean and minimal.  Subtle is the best choice of words I think.  Anyway, let me know what you think.  Do you like the design?  Is there anything you&#8217;d do differently?</p>
