								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well I&#8217;m pleased to say my new website i.e. this, is now launched!  I&#8217;m very excited about it.  I am so pleased with the design.  I am normally quite picky with myself when it comes to designing, but with this it seems to have gone really well.  I wanted to achieve a minimalist bare but clean and professional looking site, with a minimal colour palette.  I chose green because a, it&#8217;s my favourite colour and b, I think it&#8217;s so fresh and vibrant.  With the light grey colour palette, there needed to be a strong colour to give the site some life, which I think the green has done nicely.</p>
<p>I had to create the logo as well which I think works well with the brand.  The forward slash between the words is a reference to the web.  I&#8217;m looking forwards to adapting the design to some business cards.  When I get them done I&#8217;ll take some pictures and post on here.</p>
<p>I also love the design I did on the previous site to this one &#8211; <a title="Photography E-Commerce Site" href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/projects/photography-e-commerce-site/">David Speight Photography</a>, also very clean and minimal.  Subtle is the best choice of words I think.  Anyway, let me know what you think.  Do you like the design?  Is there anything you&#8217;d do differently?</p>
