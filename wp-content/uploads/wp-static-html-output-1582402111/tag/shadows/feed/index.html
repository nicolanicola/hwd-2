								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PLG Engineering of Mirfield, Huddersfield contacted me asking me whether I could create them a brochure website advertising what they did.  They found that people had been looking for them online and when they didn&#8217;t find them, were a bit unsure of them, or whether or not they existed.  They wanted this website to give themselves an online presence.  They already had a logo so I took the colours from that logo and used them in the design of the site.  The colours being red and yellow worked very well since they were a heating engineering company, so when you went on the site, you immediately had a feeling of warmth.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t need many pages, just enough to show their products, who they were and how to get in touch with them.  They were very pleased with the end product, liking how clear it was to see who they were and what they did.</p>
