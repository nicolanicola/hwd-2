								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client came to me wanting a website for his company.  He had already created a logo and knew the colour scheme he wanted.  What he didn&#8217;t want was a standard website, that looked like every other site.</p>
<p>I wanted to show in the design what my client&#8217;s business was about.  I spoke to him about who his ideal website visitors were, and what they would be looking for if they were looking to hire someone like himself.  We decided it was important that they know straight off what he did.  I achieved this through large typography on the homepage, and through the use of my clients blueprints for the background images for the pages.  I was concerned that the size of these images may impact mobile users, who would be using their mobile data allowance.  So I coded a slightly different view for mobile users &#8211; a website with just a white background on each page.  They then wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the website hogging all their mobile data allowance.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client was dissatisfied with his old website design.  The background was very dark which drowned out the photos.  He came to me wanting a fresh, bright website which let the photos, rather than the design, do the talking.  He also wanted the website to respond to different screen sizes, showing a different layout depending on if viewed on a smartphone, tablet or laptop.  The site needed to feature a prints section where people could buy a print through Paypal.</p>
<p>I designed a very minimal website based around his logo.  The theme was black &amp; white.  It was contrast.  The black and white of the logo mirrored the contrast between the colour in the photos and the minimal white background.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a very exciting project.  My client was from Bedford and had received bad service from a well known company for her website build.  She came to me wanting a logo designed and a website that was in English and Polish.  With her business being translation, she didn&#8217;t want to use an automatic language translator such as Google Translate.  I thus created her a WordPress site which she could edit fully, and that enabled her to add content in two different languages.  The website has a flag on it, which when clicked, sets a preference in the visitors internet browser.  English content or Polish content is then shown depending on which language the visitor chose.</p>
<p>The red colouring of the brand was my clients request.  I created a few website designs for her to look through, from which she chose the design you see before you.</p>
<p>I also created a logo for my client.  She wanted the words <em>pen</em> and <em>translations </em>encompassing in a logo.  The result is a speech bubble with the top of a fountain pen.</p>
