								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project was a simple redesign of the existing site.  Huddersfield Driving School already had a website.  They wanted some social icons adding such as facebook like button, and twitter share button.  They also required a feed from their facebook page, which meant whenever they made a new post on their facebook page, it would come through onto their website.</p>
<p>The site was integrated with paypal, enabling visitors to the site to buy driving lessons over the internet with their paypal account.</p>
<p>We also decided to go for a redesign as well to make it brighter and more inviting to users.  The original html and content was kept exactly the same and extra content such as the recently passed carousel was added to the top of the page.</p>
