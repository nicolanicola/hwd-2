								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Genuine Carers contacted me needing a website, fast!  They had all the imagery and content ready for the website build, and had a really good logo.</p>
<p>I took the blue &amp; the grey from their logo and replicated these colours across the site, to reinforce the brand and to invoke a sense of calmness.  To strengthen the brand identity, I manipulated the images provided using photoshop to make the carers the focus of the picture, the blue of her uniform worked great with the website&#8217;s colours.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple, yet extremely effected design, which I am very pleased with.</p>
