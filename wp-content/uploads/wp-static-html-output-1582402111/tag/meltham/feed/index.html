								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client approached me with a real need for his website to be revamped.  People found it confusing, couldn&#8217;t find what they were looking for, and worse, thought he didn&#8217;t do commercial work.</p>
<p>I worked with him to find a solution to the problem of him having two audiences &#8211; commercial and domestic customers.  Together we came up with the idea of having a tabbed menu so the specific type of customer could easily find the section they wanted.</p>
<p>I thought it was important that the site have a warm, bright and optimistic feel, as well as feeling very back to nature.  It had to feel like renewable energy.</p>
<p>My client was happy to report to me that within the first week he had already had an enquiry through the website, his other website had yielded no contacts, and had been up over a year!</p>
