								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XL Projects needed a website fast.  My client contacted me with an urgent request for a website.  They had all the content, but just needed a design to pull it altogether.  Their sister company Kelland already had a logo, so I suggested we use the same logo style as Kelland.  My client agreed.</p>
<p>I was a bit flummoxed as to how I would make a site about Injection Moulding look pretty.  However I quickly did some designs in photoshop with the content my client had gave me, using the colours from the logo.  I was very pleased with the results.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project was for an auto-electrician in Huddersfield.  They already had a website that they had built with 1and1 hosting, but wanted something with a more streamlined feel, that incorporated their logo.</p>
<p>I based the design of the site on their logo.  The logo was black and orange, so I reflected this colour scheme in the rest of the site design.  One of the things I pointed out to them on their old site was that it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear what they did, on landing on their homepage.  Bearing this in mind, I worked with Autolec HD to create a more streamlined structure, with all their services listed on one page.  Each service they provide has it&#8217;s own page, for clarity to the viewer and for SEO (search engine optimisation) purposes.  I also made sure with the design of the homepage that it was immediately clear that this was an auto electrician, by using design principles and carefully named section headings.</p>
<p>Autolec HD needed some images for their website.  So I arranged to take some with my dSLR at their premises.  I got a great shot of them both smiling naturally, have a look at their <a href="http://autolechd.co.uk/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about page</a>.</p>
