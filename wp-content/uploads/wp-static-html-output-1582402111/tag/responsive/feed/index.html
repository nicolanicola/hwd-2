								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client was dissatisfied with his old website design.  The background was very dark which drowned out the photos.  He came to me wanting a fresh, bright website which let the photos, rather than the design, do the talking.  He also wanted the website to respond to different screen sizes, showing a different layout depending on if viewed on a smartphone, tablet or laptop.  The site needed to feature a prints section where people could buy a print through Paypal.</p>
<p>I designed a very minimal website based around his logo.  The theme was black &amp; white.  It was contrast.  The black and white of the logo mirrored the contrast between the colour in the photos and the minimal white background.</p>
