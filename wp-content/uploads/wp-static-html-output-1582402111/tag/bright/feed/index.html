								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kirkburton Pre school are a small voluntary organisation based in Kirkburton, Huddersfield.  As they are a charitable organisation, they didn&#8217;t have a large budget.  I don&#8217;t mind this.  I like to help out my local area.  Help people who are doing good.</p>
<p>They already had a logo.  They weren&#8217;t sure what colours to go for and what style.  We looked at a few different preschool/nursery websites and primary school websites.  They all seemed to be aimed at children.  They used primary colours and looked more fitting to a children&#8217;s website.  It was important to recognise that this site was for parents.  That didn&#8217;t mean it had to be serious and boring.  Oh no!  They told me they used pink and green a lot in their pre school.  So I took those colours and applied it to their site.</p>
<p>Kirkburton pre school luckily had a lot of lovely images of the children, which made the website look great, it came alive.</p>
<p>As the site was build in wordpress, the volunteers were able to go in and update it themselves.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My client approached me with a real need for his website to be revamped.  People found it confusing, couldn&#8217;t find what they were looking for, and worse, thought he didn&#8217;t do commercial work.</p>
<p>I worked with him to find a solution to the problem of him having two audiences &#8211; commercial and domestic customers.  Together we came up with the idea of having a tabbed menu so the specific type of customer could easily find the section they wanted.</p>
<p>I thought it was important that the site have a warm, bright and optimistic feel, as well as feeling very back to nature.  It had to feel like renewable energy.</p>
<p>My client was happy to report to me that within the first week he had already had an enquiry through the website, his other website had yielded no contacts, and had been up over a year!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This project was a simple redesign of the existing site.  Huddersfield Driving School already had a website.  They wanted some social icons adding such as facebook like button, and twitter share button.  They also required a feed from their facebook page, which meant whenever they made a new post on their facebook page, it would come through onto their website.</p>
<p>The site was integrated with paypal, enabling visitors to the site to buy driving lessons over the internet with their paypal account.</p>
<p>We also decided to go for a redesign as well to make it brighter and more inviting to users.  The original html and content was kept exactly the same and extra content such as the recently passed carousel was added to the top of the page.</p>
