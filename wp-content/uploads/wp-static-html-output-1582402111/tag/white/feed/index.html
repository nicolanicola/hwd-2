								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Genuine Carers contacted me needing a website, fast!  They had all the imagery and content ready for the website build, and had a really good logo.</p>
<p>I took the blue &amp; the grey from their logo and replicated these colours across the site, to reinforce the brand and to invoke a sense of calmness.  To strengthen the brand identity, I manipulated the images provided using photoshop to make the carers the focus of the picture, the blue of her uniform worked great with the website&#8217;s colours.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple, yet extremely effected design, which I am very pleased with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This client, based in Huddersfield contacted me for 2 websites.  They specialise in auto electrics in Huddersfield.  After completing their first website, <a title="Autolec HD, Car Electrician" href="https://huddersfieldwebsitedesigner.co.uk/websites/autolec-hd-car-electrician/">Autolec HD</a>, I went onto design their motorhome website.  My client wanted a clean, minimal site to appeal to the more discerning customer.  After receiving the stock photography my client had purchased, I realised that the motorhome image  sold the website and the brand on it&#8217;s own.  So I decided to make that the main focus of the homepage.  Not only does it immediately says what the website is about, but it looks great too.  I echoed this style through the rest of the site, keeping it white and minimal.</p>
<p>I advised my client how to write the content for SEO and added this to the site.  Autolec now have the freedom to edit the website, adding images and text whenever they want, they don&#8217;t have to ring me any time they need anything changing.</p>
